          <h2>Early 20th century</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first half of the 20th century saw Uruguay as one of the most
              prosperous nations in Latin America, known for its political
              stability, social welfare programs, and progressive policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1903, the Colorado Party and the National Party established a
              bipartisan system that dominated Uruguayan politics for decades.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Mid-20th century</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the mid-20th century, Uruguay faced some political challenges,
              including military interventions and economic fluctuations.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the 1950s and 1960s, the country experienced a period of
              economic growth and industrialization, known as the "Uruguayan
              miracle".
            </li>
            <li>
              However, political repression and human rights violations
              increased during the 1960s and 1970s as Uruguay faced the rise of
              leftist guerrilla movements and growing tensions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Late 20th century</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In 1973, a military coup took place, leading to the establishment
              of a military dictatorship. This period, known as the "Dirty War,"
              involved widespread human rights abuses, including torture and
              forced disappearances.
            </li>
            <li>
              The military dictatorship ruled until 1985 when Uruguay
              transitioned back to democracy, marking the beginning of a new era
              of political freedom and civil liberties.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1989, the left-leaning Frente Amplio (Broad Front) coalition
              was formed, becoming a major political force in Uruguay.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>21st century</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the early 2000s, Uruguay faced economic challenges, including a
              severe financial crisis. However, the country implemented various
              reforms that contributed to its recovery.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the 2010s, Uruguay continued to enjoy a relatively stable
              political climate and social progress, including the legalization
              of same-sex marriage (2013) and the decriminalization of abortion
              (2012).
            </li>
            <li>
              The country also pursued a progressive drug policy, legalizing the
              production, sale, and consumption of marijuana in 2013, becoming
              the first country in the world to do so.
            </li>
