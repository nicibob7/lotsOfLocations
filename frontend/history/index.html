        <h2>Early 20th century</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first half of the 20th century saw Uruguay as one of the most
            prosperous nations in Latin America, known for its political
            stability, social welfare programs, and progressive policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1903, the Colorado Party and the National Party established a
            bipartisan system that dominated Uruguayan politics for decades.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column" onclick="flipColumn(2)">
        <h2>Mid-20th century</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the mid-20th century, Uruguay faced some political challenges,
            including military interventions and economic fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the 1950s and 1960s, the country experienced a period of economic
            growth and industrialization, known as the "Uruguayan miracle."
          </li>
          <li>
            However, political repression and human rights violations increased
            during the 1960s and 1970s as Uruguay faced the rise of leftist
            guerrilla movements and growing tensions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column" onclick="flipColumn(3)">
        <h2>Late 20th century</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 1973, a military coup took place, leading to the establishment of
            a military dictatorship. This period, known as the "Dirty War,"
            involved widespread human rights abuses, including torture and
            forced disappearances.
          </li>
          <li>
            The military dictatorship ruled until 1985 when Uruguay transitioned
            back to democracy, marking the beginning of a new era of political
            freedom and civil liberties.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1989, the left-leaning Frente Amplio (Broad Front) coalition was
            formed, becoming a major political force in Uruguay.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column" onclick="flipColumn(4)">
        <h2>21st century</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the early 2000s, Uruguay faced economic challenges, including a
            severe financial crisis. However, the country implemented various
            reforms that contributed to its recovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            During the 2010s, Uruguay continued to enjoy a relatively stable
            political climate and social progress, including the legalization of
            same-sex marriage (2013) and the decriminalization of abortion
            (2012).
          </li>
          <li>
            The country also pursued a progressive drug policy, legalizing the
            production, sale, and consumption of marijuana in 2013, becoming the
            first country in the world to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2019, Luis Lacalle Pou, a member of the center-right National
            Party, won the presidential election, ending 15 years of left-wing
            rule under the Frente Amplio.
          </li>
