  <h3 class="cardText">Candombe</h3>
  <p class="cardText">Candombe is a traditional Afro-Uruguayan music and dance style that originated in Uruguay, particularly in the city of Montevideo. Candombe is characterized by its distinctive rhythm, which is produced by a set of three types of drums: chico, repique, and piano drums. These drums are played in a synchronized manner to create intricate and syncopated rhythms that are the foundation of the music. The rhythms are accompanied by chanting, singing, and dancing.</p>

    <h3 class="cardText">Tango</h3>
    <p class="cardText">Tango is a partner dance and social dance that originated around 1880 along the RÃ­o de la Plata. While tango's origins are closely linked to both Argentina and Uruguay, it's fair to say that both countries contributed to the development and spread of this iconic dance and music genre. Tango remains an important part of Uruguay's cultural heritage, and Montevideo continues to have a vibrant tango scene with its own distinct interpretations and styles.</p>

    Here are some of the prominent genres and artists in Uruguay's music scene:
    <li>Candombe: Candombe is a traditional music and dance genre that 
        originated in Uruguay during the colonial era. It is closely
         associated with the Afro-Uruguayan community.
          Candombe involves the use of three types of drums called "tambores,"
           which are played in sync to create rhythmic patterns. The Carnival
            in Montevideo is a popular time to experience the vibrant candombe performances.</li>
    <li>Murga: Murga is a form of musical theater and a vital
         part of Uruguay's Carnival celebrations. Murga groups consist of singers
         , musicians, and dancers who perform satirical and social
          commentary through song and dance. The lyrics 
          often touch on political and social issues.</li>
    <li>Tango: While tango is famously associated with Argentina,
         Uruguay has also played a significant role in the genre's 
         development. Tango has a presence in Uruguayan culture and music,
          with artists performing both traditional and modern interpretations of the dance.</li>
    <li>Canto popular: Uruguay has a strong singer-songwriter
         tradition, with many artists crafting heartfelt
          and poetic lyrics set to acoustic guitar melodies. 
          This genre often delves into social and political themes 
          and has gained popularity across Latin America.</li>
    <li>Rock and Pop: Uruguay has a vibrant rock 
        and pop music scene, with numerous bands and 
        solo artists producing music in both Spanish and English.
         Some of these artists have gained international recognition.</li>
    <li>Milonga: Similar to tango, milonga is
         another traditional music and dance genre with
          African roots. It is characterized by its 
          rhythmic style and often features romantic themes.</li>
