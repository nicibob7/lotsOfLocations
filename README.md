# Lots of Locations (LOL)

Lots of Locations is a web app devised by the Lots of Learning Initiative to combat lack of engagement with non-STEM subjects while making fun the focus of the experience. 

On visiting the homepage, users are greeted with a map of the world asked to guess the country marked with a pin. Once the country has been guessed correctly, users must complete a mini-quiz to be able to reach the country homepage.

From the country homepage, users can learn about the country, its language, history, music and art. 

With LOL, students can learn and travel the world without needing a passport!
